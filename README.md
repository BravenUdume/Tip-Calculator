# Tip-Calculator
This Project allows for restaurants to calculate how much tips customers should give to their server.
It uses the total price accumulated by the customer(s) and the number of individuals to figure out how much each person needs to tip the server and in a situation where it's only one customer, the app doesn't divide the tip.
